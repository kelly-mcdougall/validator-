            <abstract>
                <p>Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has focused on analyzing the brain as a network,
                    rather than as a collection of independent regions. Prior studies taking this approach
                    have found that individual differences in the degree of modularity of the brain network
                    relate to performance on cognitive tasks. However, inconsistent results concerning the
                    direction of this relationship have been obtained, with some tasks showing better
                    performance as modularity increases and other tasks showing worse performance. A recent
                    theoretical model [Chen, M., &#x0026; Deem, M. W. 2015. Development of modularity in the
                    neural activity of children&#x0027;s brains. <italic>Physical Biology, 12,</italic>
                    016009] suggests that these inconsistencies may be explained on the grounds that
                    high-modularity networks favor performance on simple tasks whereas low-modularity networks
                    favor performance on more complex tasks. The current study tests these predictions by
                    relating modularity from resting-state fMRI to performance on a set of simple and complex
                    behavioral tasks. Complex and simple tasks were defined on the basis of whether they did
                    or did not draw on executive attention. Consistent with predictions, we found a negative
                    correlation between individuals&#x0027; modularity and their performance on a composite
                    measure combining scores from the complex tasks but a positive correlation with
                    performance on a composite measure combining scores from the simple tasks. These results
                    and theory presented here provide a framework for linking measures of whole-brain
                    organization from network neuroscience to cognitive processing.</p>

            <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
            <p>Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has moved away from analyzing the function of localized
                brain structures toward analysis of the brain as a network. Previous studies have shown that
                the human brain is organized into different subnetworks, termed modules (Sporns &#x0026;
                Betzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2016</xref>; Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib61">2011</xref>; Meunier, Lambiotte, &#x0026; Bullmore, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib54">2010</xref>; He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2009</xref>;
                Meunier, Lambiotte, Fornito, Ersche, &#x0026; Bullmore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55"
                    >2009</xref>), which support different aspects of behavioral function, for example,
                modules for visual perception, motor control, and attentional processing (Bassett, Yang,
                Wymbs, &#x0026; Grafton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2015</xref>; Bertolero, Yeo,
                &#x0026; D&#x0027;Esposito, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2015</xref>; Bassett et al.,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2011</xref>; Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib72">2009</xref>). Understanding the network organization of the brain has been
                advanced using graph theory to quantify various local and global properties of its
                organization, with the nodes of the network defined by brain regions and edges between nodes
                as connections, determined either by structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor
                imaging or by functional connectivity derived from resting-state or task-based fMRI, between
                these regions (Rosenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2016</xref>; Finn et al.,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2015</xref>; Rubinov &#x0026; Sporns, <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2010</xref>; Bullmore &#x0026; Sporns, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib13">2009</xref>). The current work focuses on a global measure of network
                organization&#x2014;modularity. Modularity characterizes the community structure of the
                network in terms of the relative strength of within- and between-module connections. Using
                Newman&#x0027;s algorithm, nodes in the network are sorted into modules so as to maximize this
                value separately for each individual (Newman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2006</xref>;
                Girvan &#x0026; Newman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2002</xref>). Individuals differ in
                their modularity, and the degree of modularity has been found to relate to characteristics
                such as age (Chen &#x0026; Deem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015</xref>; Geerligs,
                Renken, Saliasi, Maurits, &#x0026; Lorist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2015</xref>;

                Bullmore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2009</xref>), mental state (Andric &#x0026;
                Hasson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2015</xref>; Godwin, Barry, &#x0026; Marois, <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2015</xref>), and neurological status (Fornito, Zalesky,
                &#x0026; Breakspear, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2015</xref>; Alexander-Bloch et al.,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"
                >2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>Correlations between modularity and performance on a variety of tasks have also been reported,
                focusing on individuals within a developmental stage. However, there are inconsistencies
                regarding the direction of the relationship. For example, Stevens, Tappon, Garg, and Fair
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2012</xref>) reported a positive correlation between
                modularity and performance on a visual working memory task, whereas Meunier et al. (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2014</xref>) reported a negative correlation with odor
                recognition. Even within the same group of participants, the direction of the correlation
                varies as a function of task. Alavash, Doebler, Holling, Thiel, and Gie&#x00DF;ing (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2015</xref>) report a positive correlation between modularity
                and visual working memory performance but a trend toward a negative correlation with a complex
                working memory span task. Thus, although there is accumulating evidence that whole-brain
                measures relate to behavioral performance (Bassett et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"
                    >2015</xref>; Gu, Pasqualetti, et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2015</xref>; Gu,
                Satterthwaite, et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2015</xref>; Medaglia, Lynall,
                &#x0026; Bassett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2015</xref>; Power &#x0026; Petersen,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2013</xref>; Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib61">2011</xref>), the exact relationship between modularity and performance is
                unclear.</p>
            <p>Deem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013</xref>) proposed a theory derived from theoretical
                biology that posits that high-modularity systems afford greater evolutionary fitness at
                shorter timescales whereas low-modularity systems afford greater fitness at longer timescales.
                This general principle may help to explain why high modularity is beneficial for some tasks
                whereas low modularity is beneficial for others. Chen and Deem (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib15">2015</xref>) developed a computational model to examine this principle in
                recognition memory. Simulations showed that high-modularity architectures resulted in better
                performance in recognition memory with shorter response deadlines, whereas low-modularity
                architectures resulted in better performance with longer response deadlines. More generally,
                this principle leads to the prediction that high-modularity architectures are better for
                simple tasks, which are completed over a short timescale and draw mainly on a specific module,
                whereas low-modularity architectures are better for complex tasks, which take more time and
                that draw on the interaction of several modules. On the basis of this interpretation, the
                inconsistent previous findings relating modularity to performance might be due to variation in
                the complexity of the tasks.</p>
            <p>Thus, in this study, we varied task complexity and investigated whether the predicted relation
                between modularity and complexity on task performance would be observed in a population of
                young adults. For complex tasks, we selected an operation span task (Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock,
                &#x0026; Engle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">2005</xref>), a visual arrays STM test
                (Rouder, Morey, Morey, &#x0026; Cowan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2011</xref>; Cowan,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2001</xref>), an auditory digit span task (Unsworth
                &#x0026; Engle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">2007</xref>), a cued task-switching paradigm
                (Kiesel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>), and a measure of conflict
                resolution in the domain of visuospatial attention from the Attention Network Task (ANT; Fan,
                McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, &#x0026; Posner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2002</xref>).
                These tasks were identified as complex because each relies on executive attention, that is,
                the ability to control attention. Operation span and cued task-switching require shifting
                between tasks. Performance on the visual arrays task has also been demonstrated to relate to
                attentional control abilities (Shipstead, Lindsey, Marshall, &#x0026; Engle, <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2014</xref>). Although digit span task is often thought as
                reflecting passive short-term maintenance, other evidence indicates that it shares many
                cognitive components with complex span measures, including controlled search of memory,
                particularly when longer lists are presented for recall (Unsworth &#x0026; Engle, <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">2007</xref>). The conflict resolution measure taps into the
                coordination of perception and cognitive control. Simple tasks included two simple
                visuospatial attention measures, alerting and orienting, again from the ANT, and a
                &#x201C;traffic light&#x201D; task in which participants press a button when a red square
                turns into a green circle. The alerting and orienting measures from the ANT reflect automatic
                response to exogenous attentional cues (Corbetta &#x0026; Shulman, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib17">2002</xref>), whereas the traffic light reflects the ability to respond to
                low-level visual properties. Composite simple and complex scores were generated from the
                behavioral measures by averaging the standard scores with the complex and simple tasks. Given
                the great differences in the tasks going into the composites and the variety of abilities that
                are tapped by each, one would not expect high correlations among the tasks. However, by
                forming a composite of the measures, one can tap the cognitive mechanisms common to the tasks
                within a composite and improve the reliability of the dependent measure (Nunnally &#x0026;
                Bernstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">1994</xref>; Winer, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib81">1971</xref>). These composite measures were correlated with modularity as
                measured by functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI. According to our theoretical model,
                the young adults with higher modularity should show better performance on the simple
                composite, whereas those with lower modularity should show better performance on the complex
                composite.</p>

                    <p>Resting-state fMRI scans were conducted at the Core for Advanced Magnetic Resonance
                        Imaging at Baylor College of Medicine. Images were obtained on a 3-T Siemens
                        (Erlangen, Germany) Magnetom Tim Trio scanner equipped with a 12-channel head coil.
                        Foam pads were used to keep participants&#x0027; heads stable during the scanning. A
                        high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired by using magnetization
                        prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence in the sagittal direction (repetition time =
                        2500 msec, echo time = 4.71 msec, field of view = 256 mm, voxel size = 1 &#x00D7; 1
                        &#x00D7; 1 mm<sup>3</sup>). Three 7-min resting-state functional runs were obtained by
                        using an EPI sequence as follows: repetition time = 2000 msec, echo time = 40 msec,
                        field of view = 220 mm, voxel size = 3 &#x00D7; 3 mm<sup>2</sup>, and slice thickness
                        = 4 mm. Each resting-state run had 210 volumes, and each volume had 34 slices in the
                        axial plane to cover the whole brain. All 52 participants completed the imaging
                        session.</p>

                    <title>Preprocessing</title>
                    <p>Image preprocessing was conducted using the AFNI software (AFNI version:
                        AFNI_2011_12_21_1014; Cox, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1996</xref>). The first
                        six volumes of each functional run were discarded to allow stabilization of the BOLD
                        signal. Preprocessing procedures basically followed the pipelines recommended by Jo et
                        al.&#x0027;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2013</xref>) article and AFNI&#x0027;s
                        script <italic>afni_proc.py</italic>. Each functional run was preprocessed separately,
                        including de-spiking of large fluctuations for some time points, slice timing, and
                        head motion correction. Then, each participant&#x0027;s functional images were aligned
                        to that individual&#x0027;s structural image, warped to the Talairach standard space,
                        and resampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels. Next, the functional images were spatially
                        smoothed with a 4-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. A whole-brain mask was then generated and
                        applied for all subsequent analyses. A multiple regression model was then applied to
                        each voxel&#x0027;s time series to regress out several nuisance signals, including
                        third-order polynomial baseline trends, six head motion correction parameters, and six
                        derivatives of head motion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Band-pass
                        (0.005&#x2013;0.1 Hz) filtering and outlier censoring were conducted in the same
                        regression model. The outlier censoring removed the time points in which head motion
                        exceeded a distance (Euclidean norm) of 0.2 mm with respect to the previous time point
                        or in which &#x003E;10&#x0025; of whole-brain voxels were considered as outliers by
                        AFNI&#x0027;s 3dToutcount. The residual time series after application of the
                        regression model were used for the following network analyses.</p>

                    <title>Network Reconstruction and Modularity Calculation</title>
                    <p>The whole-brain network was reconstructed based on several prominent parcellations of
                        the brain: Brodmann&#x0027;s areas (BAs); Eickhoff&#x2013;Zilles atlas (Eickhoff et
                        al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2005</xref>); functional areas identified in
                        Power et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2011</xref>); spatially coherent areas
                        identified in Craddock, James, Holtzheimer, Hu, and Mayberg (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                            rid="bib20">2012</xref>); and a recently published parcellation based on
                        structural and function data from the Human Connectome Project (Glasser et al., <xref
                            ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2016</xref>). We illustrate the network reconstruction
                        methods for the 84 BAs (42 BAs for the left and right hemispheres, respectively).
                        These 84 BAs were derived from the Brodmann atlas in AFNI Talairach&#x2013;Daemon
                        (AFNI version: AFNI_2011_12_21_1014; Lancaster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                            rid="bib44">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2000</xref>). This
                        Brodmann atlas mainly covered the cerebral cortex of the brain. Each BA served as a
                        node of the network, and the mean time series was extracted by averaging the
                        preprocessed time series across all voxels in that BA. The edge between any two nodes
                        in the network was defined by functional connectivity&#x2014;that is, the Pearson
                        correlation of the time series for those two nodes. Edges for all pairs of nodes in
                        the network were estimated, resulting in an 84 &#x00D7; 84 correlation matrix. The
                        correlation matrix was calculated for each run and each participant separately, and an
                        averaged correlation matrix across three runs was obtained for each participant (<xref
                            ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We did not concatenate the three runs
                        for each participant because this would introduce a large discontinuity in the fMRI
                        signal at the point of concatenation, leading to spurious correlation. We applied
                        Newman&#x0027;s algorithm (Newman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2006</xref>) to
                        each individual&#x0027;s averaged correlation matrix to calculate the modularity value
                        for that participant. To do this, we first took the absolute values of each
                        correlation and set all the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix to zero. Fewer
                        than 0.05&#x0025; of the elements in the matrix were negative. The resulting matrix
                        was binarized by setting the largest 400 edges (i.e., 11.47&#x0025; graph density) in
                        the network to 1 and all others to 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).
                        We also considered the top 300 (8.61&#x0025;) and 500 (14.34&#x0025;) edges,
                        respectively, to assess the consistency of correlation with modularity across
                        different numbers of edges. This binarization process has been argued to improve
                        detection of modularity by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (Chen &#x0026; Deem,
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015</xref>). Modularity was defined as in
                        Equation 1, where <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is 1 if there is an
                        edge between BAs <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> and 0 otherwise, the value
                        of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> =
                            &#x03A3;<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>
                        <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the degree of BA
                            <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>e</italic> = &#x00BD;
                                &#x03A3;<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>
                        <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the total number of edges, here set
                        to 300, 400, and 500, respectively. Newman&#x0027;s algorithm was applied to the
                        binarized matrix to obtain the (maximal) modularity value and the corresponding
                        partitioning of BAs into different modules for each participant.<xref ref-type="fn"

                    <p>A group average correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) was
                        obtained by averaging the mean correlation matrices across all participants. The
                        partitioning into modules was also conducted at the group level. To assess individual
                        variability in the modular structure of the brain, we maximally aligned each
                        participant&#x0027;s partitioning of BAs with the partitioning identified from the
                        group average correlation matrix. When comparing the distance between two assignments
                        of BAs to modules, we take into account that the labeling of the modules can be
                        permuted and that the number of modules of the two assignments need not be identical.
                        Thus, the maximal alignment is the one that minimizes the distance over all
                        permutations of the assignment with the greater (or equal) number of modules. The
                        value <italic>d</italic> is the number of nodes whose modular assignment differed

                        the number of modules in Assignment 1 is not greater than that in Assignment 2. To
                        assess which cortical regions drove this individual variation in modular structure, we
                        also calculated, for each of the 84 BAs, the number of participants for whom that BA
                        was assigned to a different module than the assignment for group average data.</p>
                    <p>Although BAs have the virtue of covering most of the gray matter, many of the areas are
                        quite large, meaning that each BA likely contains multiple functionally selective
                        regions. Given that each BA can only be assigned to one module, that modular
                        assignment may only be appropriate for a subregion, thereby potentially reducing the
                        relation between modularity and behavioral performance. Thus, we also calculated
                        modularity for each participant based on another anatomical parcellation, which is

                            ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2012</xref>). On each trial, participants saw an
                        arithmetic problem for 2 sec, for example, (2 &#x00D7; 3) + 1, and were instructed to
                        solve it as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants judged whether a digit
                        presented on the next screen was a correct solution to the previous arithmetic
                        problem. After the arithmetic problem, a letter was presented on the screen for 800
                        msec that participants were instructed to remember. A single trial consisted of
                        repeating these steps six or seven times. At the end of each trial, participants
                        recalled the letters in the order in which they were presented. The recall screen
                        consisted of a 3 &#x00D7; 4 matrix of letters, and participants used the mouse to
                        check the boxes aside letters during recall. There were 12 trials for each set size
                        (six or seven arithmetic problem&#x2013;letter pairs, randomly presented), resulting
                        in 156 letters and 156 arithmetic problems. The dependent measure was the total number
                        of letters recalled at the correct position with a maximum of 156. Before the
                        experiment, participants practiced with (1) a block involving only letter recall, (2)
                        a block involving only arithmetic problems, and (3) a mixed block in which the trial
                        had the same procedure as in the experimental trials. Practice blocks included only
                        set sizes of 2, 3, or 4.</p>

                        and then by multicolored masks for 500 msec. A single probe square was then presented
                        at one of the locations where the colored squares had appeared. Participants had to
                        judge whether the probe square had the same color as the one at the same location. The
                        order of different array sizes was random. There were 32 trials at each array
                        size&#x2014;half of which required positive responses; and half, negative. The visual

                        given set size (60&#x0025; accuracy). Digit span was calculated by estimating the set
                        size at which a participant would score 60&#x0025; through linear interpolation
                        between the two sizes spanning this accuracy threshold.</p>

                        to a preceding cue word. If the cue was &#x201C;color,&#x201D; participants pressed a
                        button to indicate whether the object was blue or yellow, and if the cue was
                        &#x201C;shape,&#x201D; they pressed a button to indicate whether the object was a
                        square or a triangle. The same buttons were used for the two tasks. RT was recorded
                        from the onset of the object. For half of the trials, the cue was the same as that in
                        the previous trial (a repeat trial), and for the other half, the cue changed (a switch
                        trial). For each condition, to take into account both RT and accuracy in a single
                        measure, we calculated an inverse efficiency (IE) score (Townsend &#x0026; Ashby,
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">1983</xref>) defined as mean RT/proportion
                        correct. The task-shifting cost was measured as the difference in IE scores between
                        repeat and switch trials. Cue&#x2013;stimulus interval (CSI) was varied, which is the
                        time between onset of the cue and onset of the object, using CSIs of 200, 400, 600,
                        and 800 msec. However, as the effect of modularity on IE did not differ for different
                        CSIs, the data were averaged across CSI. In total, there were 256 repeat trials and
                        256 switch trials.</p>

                    <title>Attention Network Test</title>
                    <p>The ANT (Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2002</xref>) was used to measure
                        three different attentional components: alerting, orienting, and conflict resolution.
                        This task involves a simple visual discrimination&#x2014;that is, indicating whether a
                        central arrow is pointing left or right via a mouse press. The arrow(s) appeared above
                        or below the fixation cross, which was in the center of the screen. The central arrow
                        appeared alone on a third of the trials and was flanked by two arrows on the left and
                        two on the right on the remaining two thirds of the trials. The flanking arrow trials
                        were evenly split between a congruent condition in which they pointed in the same
                        direction as the central arrow and an incongruent condition in which they pointed in
                        the opposite direction. In the neutral condition, there were no flanking arrows. The
                        timing of the appearance of the arrow(s) was cued by zero, one, or two asterisks,
                        which appeared for 100 msec on the screen. The interval between offset of the cue and
                        onset of the arrow was 400 msec. The four cue conditions were (1) no cue condition;
                        (2) a cue at fixation; (3) double-cue condition, with one cue above and the other
                        below fixation; and (4) spatial cue condition, where the cue appeared above or below
                        the fixation to indicate where the arrows would appear, provided both timing and
                        location information. Thus, the task had a 4 cue &#x00D7; 3 flanker condition
                        factorial design. The experimental trials consisted of three sessions, with 96 trials
                        in each session and eight trials in each cell of each condition. For half of all
                        trials, arrows were presented above the fixation; and for the other half, below. In
                        addition, for half of the trials, the middle arrow pointed left; and for the other
                        half, right. The order of trials in each session was random. Before the experimental
                        trials, 24 practice trials with feedback were given to the participants.</p>
                    <p>RTs and accuracy were recorded with mean RT based on correct trials only. IE was
                        calculated for each condition. The alerting effect was computed by subtracting the IE
                        for the no-cue condition from the IE for the double-cue condition. The orienting
                        effect was computed by subtracting the IE for the center cue condition from the IE for
                        the spatial cue condition. The conflict effect was computed by subtracting the IE for
                        the congruent condition from the IE for the incongruent condition. To make the
                        direction of the conflict effect the same as alerting and orienting effects, we
                        reversed the sign of the conflict effect. Thus, the more negative the conflict effect
                        value, the greater the interference from the incongruent flankers. The alerting and
                        orienting effects both tap into sensitivity to exogenous, or stimulus-driven, cues
                        within the visual domain, whereas the conflict effect taps individuals&#x0027; ability
                        to direct attention to the central cue and ignore conflicting flankers, thus drawing
                        on endogenous, or participant-driven, attentional abilities (Raz &#x0026; Buhle, <xref

                    <p>In this task, participants saw a red square in the center of screen, which was replaced
                        after an unpredictable time delay (from 2 to 3 sec) by a green circle. Participants
                        pressed a button as quickly as possible when they saw the green circle. There were 25
                        trials in total. Mean RT was calculated for each participant.</p>

                <title>Composite Scores and Correlation Analyses</title>
                <p>Split-half reliability for each task was calculated using the Spearman&#x2013;Brown
                    prophecy formula (Allen &#x0026; Yen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1979</xref>). As
                    discussed in the results, the reliabilities were moderate to high for all except for that
                    for the alerting component of the ANT. The low reliability for alerting is consistent with
                    previous studies showing higher reliabilities for the orienting and conflict components of
                    the ANT than for alerting (Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2002</xref>).
                    Given the absence of reliability for this measure, it was eliminated from consideration.
                    Two composite scores were calculated: one for complex tasks and another for simple tasks.
                    In order that higher numbers would be associated with better performance for all tasks,
                    the values for shift cost and traffic light were reverse scored by multiplying by
                    &#x2212;1. Then, for each task, standard scores (<italic>z</italic> scores) were obtained
                    based on the 40 participants who had scores on all eight tasks. A complex composite score
                    was calculated by averaging the <italic>z</italic> scores across the five complex tasks:
                    operation span, visual arrays task, digit span, task-shifting task, and the conflict
                    measure of the ANT task. A simple composite score was calculated by averaging the
                        <italic>z</italic> scores across two simple tasks: orienting from the ANT and the
                    traffic light task (RT). Participants&#x0027; modularity values were correlated with their
                    complex and simple composite scores. On the basis of the predictions of the theoretical
                    model, we expected that modularity would correlate positively with the simple composite
                    score and negatively with the complex composite score.</p>

                <title>Modular Organization of Resting-state Network</title>
                <p>For the calculations with the BA network of 400 edges (11.47&#x0025;), modularity values
                    ranged across participants from 0.33 to 0.59, with a mean of 0.47 on a scale from 0 to
                    1.0. For the BA network of 300 edges (8.61&#x0025;) and the BA network of 500 edges
                    (14.34&#x0025;), the means were 0.53 (range = 0.39&#x2013;0.64) and 0.42 (range =
                    0.31&#x2013;0.52), respectively. With the BA network of 84 nodes and 400 edges used in our
                    analysis, a value greater than 0.29 is taken to indicate a significant degree of
                    modularity as random voxel data led to <italic>M</italic> = 0.25 (<italic>SD</italic> =
                    0.022, max value out of 52 = 0.29) for our setup. The results reported below were based on
                    the BA network of 400 edges (11.47&#x0025;) without tissue-based regression, unless
                    indicated otherwise. Individuals differed to some degree in the number of modules, with
                    most (31/52) having four modules but some having three modules (14/52) or five modules
                    (7/52). The organization of brain regions into modules is described below, starting with
                    the results from the group average data, followed by a discussion of how this organization
                    varied across individuals.</p>
                <p>At the group level, the 84 BAs were organized into four modules (<xref ref-type="fig"
                        rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>). For all
                    modules, the brain regions making up the module were contiguous and symmetrical, with the
                    left and right BAs assigned to the same module for 40 of the 42 BA labels. The first
                    module (a sensory-motor module) consisted of BAs covering bilateral primary somatosensory
                    cortex (BAs 1, 2, and 3), primary motor cortex (BA 4), somatosensory association cortex
                    (BA 5), premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex (BA 6), supramarginal gyrus (BA
                    40), and ventromedial pFC (BA 25).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>5</sup></xref> The
                    second module included auditory and language-related regions covering both Broca and
                    Wernicke&#x0027;s areas, although areas were bilateral, consisting of bilateral auditory
                    cortex (BAs 41 and 42), superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), temporal pole area (BA 38),
                    insular gyrus (BA 13), primary gustatory cortex (BA 43), ventral part of dorsolateral pFC
                    (BA 46), and inferior frontal gyrus, including pars opercularis (BA 44), pars triangularis
                    (BA 45), and pars orbitalis (BA 47). The third module overlapped considerably with the
                    default mode network (Raichle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2001</xref>),
                    consisting of bilateral angular gyrus (BA 39), inferior temporal gyrus (BA 20), middle
                    temporal gyrus (BA 21), and some frontal regions, including FEFs (BA 8), the dorsal part
                    of dorsolateral pFC (BA 9), and anterior pFC (BA 10) as well as some medial regions, such
                    as anterior cingulate gyrus (BAs 24 and 32 and left BA 33) and a part of posterior
                    cingulate gyrus (left BA 31). The fourth module was the largest and most diverse. It
                    included visual, attentional, and medial memory-related areas. More specifically, this
                    module included bilateral OFC (BA 11); posterior superior parietal cortex (BA 7); primary,
                    secondary, and associative visual cortex (BAs 17, 18, and 19); and fusiform gyrus (BA 37)
                    as well as some medial regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex (BAs 23, 29, and
                    30 and right BA 31), a part of anterior cingulate gyrus (right BA 33), piriform cortex (BA
                    27), entorhinal cortex (BAs 28 and 34), and perirhinal cortex (BAs 35 and 36). The four
                    modules roughly replicated prior results on various parcellation schemes (BAs using
                    Newman&#x0027;s algorithm: Chen &#x0026; Deem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"

                    nodes within the coverage of AAL atlas using Louvain algorithm: Meunier et al., <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2010</xref>; Meunier, Lambiotte, et al., <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009</xref>). We also obtained group level modular
                    organizations for our data for other parcellations, which revealed four modules for Power
                    and Craddock&#x0027;s nodes, three for Glasser&#x0027;s nodes, and five for the
                    Eickhoff&#x2013;Zilles nodes. The modular organization was largely consistent across these
                    different networks for three of the four modules from BAs (i.e., the sensory-motor module,
                    the default-mode module, and the diverse module that covered the occipital, dorsal
                    parietal, and some frontal regions); however, the auditory/language module was not evident
                    in all other networks (for modular organizations in other networks, see Supplementary
                    Figure 2 available at the Open Science Framework: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                        xlink:href="http://osf.io/9tmhc/?view_only=7bafc4494c8e49f8a1b8c51df5823b5a"

                    the number of modules and their constituent brain regions were quite similar irrespective
                    of whether an anatomical or functional parcellation scheme was used, although some
                    differences were observed.</p>
                <p>Although the above modules represent those derived from the average correlation matrix, the
                    assignment of brain regions to modules differed considerably across participants, with
                    some brain regions showing a high degree of variation and others showing little. <xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows for each brain area the number of
                    individuals for which that area was in a module different from the average. In low-level
                    sensory and motor area, for example, posterior visual cortex and primary somatosensory and
                    motor cortex, the assignment to a module differed from the group average for only a few
                    participants. In contrast, for brain regions associated with higher-order cognitive
                    functions, for example, lateral pFC, there was large variation across participants. In
                    some temporal and parietal regions, module identity differed from the group average for
                    about half of the participants. The medial ventral frontal lobe had the most participants
                    deviate from the group average, which most likely was due to the distorted magnetic field
                    in this region, resulting in a poor signal-to-noise ratio with the typical EPI sequence.
                    Notably, however, cognitive control regions that do not experience such signal loss also
                    showed considerable variability in module assignment across individuals.</p>

                <p>To quantify individuals&#x0027; difference in modular organization relative to the group

                    to the modular organization of the group average data, as described above. Distance ranged
                    from 14 to 48 with a mean of 33.8. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows

                <p>For the operation span task, one participant was excluded from the analysis because of a

                    (mean = 123, <italic>SD</italic> = 24). For the task-shifting task, two participants were
                    excluded as one performed at a chance level of accuracy and the other showed shift costs
                    more than 3 <italic>SD</italic>s greater than the group mean. Overall, there was a
                    significant task-shifting effect (mean shift cost = 194, <italic>SD</italic> = 94;
                        <italic>t</italic>(49) = 14.54, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; .0001). Forty-three
                    participants participated in the visual arrays task and the ANT task. The mean accuracy
                    for visual arrays was 89.5&#x0025;, with a standard deviation of 5.4&#x0025;, which is
                    similar to that from prior reports (Cowan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2001</xref>).
                    Forty-four participants participated in the digit span task. The mean capacity for digit
                    span was 7.26, with a standard deviation of 0.94. For the ANT task, one
                    participant&#x0027;s data for the conflict task were excluded as the conflict effect was
                    more than 4 <italic>SD</italic>s greater than the group mean. Overall, for the ANT task,
                    the mean findings replicated prior results (Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"

                    light task. The group mean RT was 227 msec, with a standard deviation of 17 msec. All
                    behavioral tasks except for alerting had medium to high reliabilities. Specifically, the
                    Spearman&#x2013;Brown prophecy reliabilities were .85 for operation span, .84 for the
                    visual arrays task, .90 for digit span, .68 for shifting task, .55 for conflict measure of
                    ANT task, .38 for orienting measure of ANT task, and .94 for the traffic light task.
                    However, the reliability for the alerting measures from the ANT task was &#x2212;.31.
                    Thus, this measure was eliminated from further consideration.</p>
                <p>Composite scores were generated based on 40 participants who had scores on all tasks. We
                    examined the pattern of correlations between the task scores and the composites and
                    between the two composites to verify that these composites tapped different underlying
                    cognitive constructs. Specifically, we found that all five complex tasks&#x0027; measures
                    correlated significantly with the complex composite score (<italic>r</italic> = .63,
                        <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; .001, for operation span; <italic>r</italic> = .49,

                    .37, <italic>p</italic> = .018, for shifting) but were not significantly correlated with
                    the simple composite score (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.25, <italic>p</italic> = .13,
                    for operation span; <italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> = .09, for visual arrays;
                        <italic>r</italic> = .08, <italic>p</italic> = .63, for digit span; <italic>r</italic>

                    &#x2212;.15, <italic>p</italic> = .34, for shifting). For the simple composite score,
                    given that only two measures went into the composite, the correlations between the
                    individual measures and the composite were necessarily high and equivalent
                        (<italic>r</italic> = .73, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; .001, for orienting measures of

                    light task). The scores from the simple tasks were not significantly correlated with the
                    complex composite score (<italic>r</italic> = .03, <italic>p</italic> = .84, for orienting

                    the traffic light task). The correlation between the simple and complex composite scores

                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">1992</xref>) showed that the two correlations differed

                    relation between modularity and performance was mediated by task complexity. We also
                    correlated the complex and simple composite scores with the modularity values derived from
                    the binarized matrices based on 300 and 500 edges, and similar patterns were observed: (1)
                    300 edges (8.61&#x0025;): <italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.32 and <italic>p</italic> = .044

                    difference: <italic>z</italic> = 2.80, <italic>p</italic> = .0052. Thus, the pattern of

                <p>Modularity derived from another anatomical network (Eickhoff&#x2013;Zilles) had a
                    marginally significant negative correlation with the complex composite score
                        (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.305, <italic>p</italic> = .056) and a nonsignificant

                        <italic>p</italic> = .24). The difference between the two correlations was significant
                        (<italic>z</italic> = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> = .03). This pattern basically
                    replicated that from the Brodmann network. Modularity derived from Power et al.&#x0027;s
                    network (Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2011</xref>) had a nonsignificant
                    negative correlation with the complex composite score (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.25,
                        <italic>p</italic> = .12) and a near-zero correlation with the simple composite score
                        (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.057, <italic>p</italic> = .73). The difference between
                    the two correlations was not significant (<italic>z</italic> = 0.85, <italic>p</italic> =
                    .40). These findings most likely result because of the much lower coverage of gray matter
                    for the Power et al.&#x0027;s nodes than for the BAs. On the basis of our calculations of
                    the total number of voxels of the brain areas covered by the masks from the two sets of
                    nodes, the BAs covered about three times as much gray matter as the areas defined by Power
                    et al.&#x0027;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2011</xref>) nodes. For modularity
                    based on Craddock et al.&#x0027;s 100-node parcellation and a recently released functional
                    parcellation with greater gray matter coverage (Glasser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="bib35">2016</xref>), patterns of correlations with the behavioral composite
                    scores were similar to that for the Brodmann network, but the correlations did not reach
                    significance (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.217, <italic>p</italic> = .18 for the complex
                    composite and <italic>r</italic> = .154, <italic>p</italic> = .343 for the simple
                    composite for Craddock&#x0027;s network; <italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;.257,
                        <italic>p</italic> = .109 for the complex composite and <italic>r</italic> = .151,
                        <italic>p</italic> = .352 for the simple composite for Glasser&#x0027;s network).
                    However, there was a marginally significant difference between the two correlations
                        (<italic>z</italic> = 1.77, <italic>p</italic> = .077) for Glasser&#x0027;s network,
                    but the difference did not reach significance for Craddock&#x0027;s network
                        (<italic>z</italic> = 1.61, <italic>p</italic> = .108). Aside from Power et
                    al.&#x0027;s network, the correlations with behavior for different parcellation schemes
                    were similar in showing a negative correlation with the complex composite and a positive
                    correlation with the simple composite, with the difference between the two being
                    significant or marginally so.</p>
                <p>Given that the interval between resting-state fMRI session and behavioral testing session
                    varied substantially across participants, we investigated whether the strength of
                    correlations with modularity differed as a function of this interval. For each task, we
                    regressed the dependent measure on modularity, absolute value of the number of days
                    between resting-state fMRI and task completion, because for a few participants, tasks were
                    completed before fMRI data were collected and the interaction of these two variables.
                    Rather than perform this analysis with all of the dependent measures of modularity
                    described above, we used only the BA-network 400-edge modularity measure, as this network
                    showed the strongest correlations with the simple and complex composite scores when we
                    collapsed time interval.</p>
                <p>Among the complex tasks, operation span and conflict from the ANT task showed a decreasing
                    correlation with modularity as the number of days increased, with the interaction between
                    modularity and days being significant for operation span (<italic>p</italic> = .02) and
                    marginally so for conflict (<italic>p</italic> = .07). For both tasks, correlations were
                    moderately high at the shortest interval but declined substantially over days. Task
                    shifting did not show a significant interaction between modularity and days
                        (<italic>p</italic> = .22). However, given that operation span and shift cost had the
                    largest range of days and included the shortest intervals, we also computed a composite
                    score combining standardized operation span and shift cost scores into a single measure.
                    For this composite measure, there was a significant interaction between days and
                    modularity (<italic>p</italic> = .04), with correlations within day groups ranging from
                    &#x2212;.59 (<italic>p</italic> = .04) for Day group 1 to .04 (<italic>p</italic> = .89)
                    for Day group 4.</p>
                <p>For the remaining tasks, visual STM and digit span showed no sign of an interaction between
                    modularity and number of days (visual STM: <italic>p</italic> = .89, digit span:
                        <italic>p</italic> = .92) nor did any of the simple tasks (orienting and traffic
                    light: both <italic>p</italic>s &#x003E; .73). It is unclear whether this failure to find
                    an interaction relates to specifics of these tasks or to the fact that all of the day
                    intervals, including the shortest one, were quite long.</p>

                    correlations between the dependent measure and modularity were plotted for each day group.
                    For operation span and task shifting, there were four such day groups (Group 1:

                        <italic>n</italic> = 14). For the ANT, visual arrays, traffic light, and digit span
                    tasks, there were three day groups (Group 1: 30&#x2013;43 days, <italic>n</italic> = 13;
                    Group 2: 44&#x2013;82 days, <italic>n</italic> = 14; Group 3: 100&#x2013;140 days,
                        <italic>n</italic> = 16). Note that Groups 1 and 2 for the latter tasks have
                    approximately the same range of days as for Groups 3 and 4 for operation span and
                    shifting. The figure includes the three complex tasks that showed significant or

            <title>DISCUSSION</title>
            <p>The current study examined the application to brain organization of a theory derived from
                theoretical biology, which posits that high-modularity systems are advantageous over short
                timescales, whereas low-modularity systems are advantageous over longer timescales. In testing
                this theory with respect to the relation of brain organization to behavior, we related
                timescale to task complexity, as simpler tasks have fewer cognitive steps and therefore take
                less time to complete than do more complex tasks that entail a greater number of steps. Using
                Newman&#x0027;s algorithm to segregate brain regions into modules, we determined the
                modularity value for each participant and correlated modularity with behavioral performance,
                testing whether we would find the predicted interaction between complexity and modularity. The
                modules uncovered in this process consisted of subnetworks of contiguous regions that had
                fairly transparent mappings to cognitive functions. Considerable variability in terms of the
                identity of modules and the overall modularity value was found across participants. The
                findings for task correlations were generally consistent with the proposed theory. Below, we
                summarize the findings on modularity and relation of modularity to behavior and discuss their
                implications for theory.</p>

                <p>The four modules uncovered at the group level matched to a large extent those uncovered in
                    prior studies using modularity analyses of resting-state and task-based fMRI (Chen
                    &#x0026; Deem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015</xref>; Meunier et al., <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2010</xref>; He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"

                        >2009</xref>). It is also the case that the modules detected using graph theoretical
                    tools agree with modules discovered by other analytical approaches, such as independent
                    component analysis (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2009</xref>) or
                    clustering analysis (Blank, Kanwisher, &#x0026; Fedorenko, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="bib11">2014</xref>; Yeo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2011</xref>).
                    Taken together, these findings indicate that the human brain is intrinsically organized
                    into functionally different modules.</p>
                <p>Although the group data revealed a coherent set of modules, there was considerable
                    variability across individuals in terms of the assignment of brain regions to modules,
                    with interesting patterns regarding which regions were more or less likely to vary in
                    module assignment. Specifically, brain regions involving motor or primary or secondary
                    sensory processes, such as visual, somatosensory, or auditory, showed little variability.
                    On the other hand, regions associated with higher-level functions like cognitive control
                    or working memory, namely, dorsolateral prefrontal or parietal regions, showed much more
                    variability. These findings are consistent with claims that these high-level regions are
                    domain general and can be associated with a variety of sensory or motor processes or
                    representations depending on the current demands of the system. It is unclear, however,
                    why these domain-general regions might be preferentially associated during resting state
                    with different sensory or motor regions for different individuals, for instance, auditory
                    regions for one individual but visual regions for another. Perhaps these alliances depend
                    on whatever individuals tended to think about during their resting-state scans or they
                    could perhaps reflect more permanent preferences in allocation of attention because of
                    greater experience or interest in certain domains over others. There was also a tendency
                    for individuals with lower modularity to deviate more from the group average modules than
                    individuals with higher modularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Less
                    modular individuals have, by definition, a smaller difference between the within-module
                    correlations and the between-module correlations. One explanation for this trend therefore
                    is that, for less modular individuals, it is more likely that modules are more loosely
                    defined or that Newman&#x0027;s algorithm will identify an idiosyncratic set of nodes to
                    maximize the difference between within- and between-module correlations.</p>

                <title>Modularity of Brain Network and Behavioral Performance</title>
                <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, a strikingly different
                    pattern of variation in the direction of correlations for complex versus simple tasks was
                    observed, which conformed with predictions of a positive correlation with the composite
                    score for the simple tasks and a negative correlation with the composite score for complex
                    tasks. This crossover interaction between task complexity and brain modularity can be
                    interpreted with respect to how tasks make use of a combination of domain-specific and
                    domain-general processes. Previous task-related functional imaging studies have found that
                    not only domain-specific regions, such as those for speech or visuospatial attention
                    (Squire, Noudoost, Schafer, &#x0026; Moore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2013</xref>;
                    Price, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64"

                        rid="bib58">2010</xref>; Martin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2003</xref>), but
                    also domain-general attentional or cognitive control regions are activated during the
                    performance of complex tasks involving, for instance, language comprehension or working
                    memory (Fedorenko, Duncan, &#x0026; Kanwisher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"
                        >2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2013</xref>; Nee et al., <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2013</xref>). Moreover, the same patterns of
                    synchronization of those regions have been reported even when there is no specific task
                    (i.e., resting-state fMRI; Xiang, Fonteijn, Norris, &#x0026; Hagoort, <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2010</xref>; Fox &#x0026; Raichle, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="bib32">2007</xref>; Fox, Corbetta, Snyder, Vincent, &#x0026; Raichle, <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>). These latter findings indicate that such
                    coactivations or synchronization do not arise solely from the demands of specific
                    experimental paradigms but reflect the intrinsic connectivity between regions in a network
                    and further suggest that such interactions among domain-specific and domain-general
                    modules of brain organization underlie cognition. On the basis of this view, both
                    domain-specific and domain-general functions are supported by the within-module
                    connections, and interactions between domain-specific and domain-general regions are
                    supported by between-module connections. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that any
                    behavioral task relies on both within- and between-module connections, but with different
                    relative weights for each depending on task complexity. A simple task may rely more on the
                    within-module but less on between-module connections, whereas a complex task may rely more
                    on the between-module but less on the within-module connections. In fact, the measure of
                    modularity reflects these relative weights of within- and between-module connections.
                    Thus, the positive correlation between the simple composite scores and modularity suggests
                    that the strong connections within a module relative to between modules favor low-level
                    processing that draw on that module. Conversely, the negative correlation between the
                    complex composite scores and modularity suggests that relatively weak connections within a
                    module but stronger connections between modules promote high-level processing, for
                    example, some high-level regions that govern or flexibly control low-level regions, for
                    example, allowing switching between arithmetic or encoding information into memory in the
                    operation span task.</p>

                <title>Time-sensitive Correlations</title>
                <p>One unanticipated finding from the current study was that the relationship between
                    modularity and task performance depended on the time interval between neuroimaging and
                    behavioral testing. This result is clearest with the complex tasks of operation span and
                    task shifting and the conflict measure from the ANT. In all three cases, the strongest
                    correlations were observed for short intervals, with correlations approaching zero at long
                    intervals.</p>
                <p>One possible explanation for these time-sensitive correlation patterns is that neither
                    modularity nor task performance has stable individual differences. Rather, these measures
                    may all drift over time. Poldrack et al. reported substantial fluctuations in the
                    connectome structure of a single individual over the course of 18 months of testing
                    (Poldrack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2015</xref>). The stability of some of
                    the behavioral measures, for example, operation span, has also been investigated. Whereas
                    Klein and Fiss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1999</xref>) reported significant
                    test&#x2013;retest correlations on operation span with approximately 3-, 6- to 7-, and
                    10-week intervals, the raw test&#x2013;retest correlations were lowest with the longest
                    interval. At a given time point, both brain and behavior measures are reliable, which can
                    explain why a correlation is observed between modularity and task performance with a short
                    time interval. However, as time passes, the modular organization of the brain changes, as
                    does task performance, in a sort of random walk that drifts over time. Thus, after a long
                    interval, the correlation between modularity and task performance weakens. To test this
                    hypothesis, future research should investigate the stability of both resting-state
                    modularity and behavioral measures as well as the stability of the brain&#x2013;behavior
                    correlations over different intervals. Our results suggest that, rather than measures of
                    an individual&#x0027;s network structure being a fingerprint&#x2014;a stable, identifying
                    property of an individual (Finn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"
                    >2015</xref>)&#x2014;they are probably more like a snapshot, a reflection of how the brain
                    was organized at a specific time. Understanding how and why brain organization changes
                    over time remains an important area for research.</p>

                <title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
                <p>Although the pattern of results across different parcellation schemes was similar (aside
                    from the Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2011</xref>, network), the
                    strength of the correlations with the complex and simple composites and the significance
                    of the difference in correlations varied. The strongest results were obtained for the two
                    anatomical parcellation schemes, with both revealing a significant difference in the
                    correlations with the simple and complex composites in the direction predicted. It is
                    unclear why the results for the parcellations taking into account functional connectivity
                    resulted in weaker results. Because previous work argued that inappropriate node
                    definition might mischaracterize brain regions that have distinctive functions (Wig,
                    Schlaggar, &#x0026; Petersen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2011</xref>) and found
                    that nodes derived based on task-based fMRI studies did not align well with anatomical
                    parcellations (Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2011</xref>), one might
                    have expected the opposite&#x2014;that is, that using network nodes determined at least in
                    part from functional activations (e.g., Glasser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"
                        >2016</xref>) would result in modular structures more relevant to task performance and
                    thus higher correlations of modularity with behavior. However, although the correlations
                    from the functional parcellations were often not substantially lower than those determined
                    from the Brodmann parcellation, they were never substantially higher. It should be noted
                    that the only other study correlating behavior on simple and complex tasks to graph
                    theoretic measures (Cohen &#x0026; D&#x0027;Esposito, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"
                        >2016</xref>) also did not find consistently higher correlations using a functional
                    atlas than an anatomical atlas (e.g., for their relatively simple sequence tapping task,
                    the correlation with modularity from an anatomical parcellation was significant,
                        <italic>p</italic> = .03, whereas that for a functional parcellation was not,
                        <italic>p</italic> = .40). One factor to keep in mind is that modularity determined
                    from Newman&#x0027;s algorithm does not use modules determined on a priori functional
                    grounds when calculating modularity, irrespective of the network used. Instead, the
                    connectivity determined from resting-state activity is used to determine how nodes should
                    best be sorted into modules to maximize modularity. Across the different parcellation
                    schemes examined in our study, the number of modules and their constituent brain regions
                    was quite similar for the most part. It must be left to future work to determine exactly
                    how the differences that did exist in modular structure arose and what the implications of
                    these differences were for the determination of modularity values. Another issue that
                    needs to be addressed is whether the combination of quite different tasks into the complex
                    and simple composites negated any advantage for network nodes determined from particular
                    functional domains. In future work, it will be important to manipulate task complexity
                    within a given domain (e.g., manipulating working memory demands parametrically). It would
                    also be important to determine if using a set of nodes limited to those domain-specific
                    (e.g., auditory processing) and domain-general (e.g., exogenous attention) networks
                    hypothesized to be involved in a particular task would result in higher correlations with
                    behavior than whole-brain measures. Perhaps under these conditions, modularity determined
                    from subnetworks defined by functional parcellation schemes would result in higher
                    correlations with behavior than those defined anatomically. On the other hand, it is
                    possible that whole-brain measures would remain superior because connectivity to other
                    regions plays some understudied role&#x2014;for instance, in the suppression of unrelated
                    domain-specific or domain-general subnetworks (Todd, Fougnie, &#x0026; Marois, <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2005</xref>).</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>The relationship between individual differences in whole-brain modularity and performance
                    varies as a function of task complexity. Specifically, low-modularity individuals showed
                    an advantage on complex tasks, whereas high-modularity individuals showed an advantage on
                    simple tasks. These observations support predictions of a theoretical model, by which high
                    modularity increases performance for simple tasks that operate at a short timescale and
                    low modularity increases performance for complex tasks that operate at a longer timescale.
                    This new understanding allows previously reported, and conflicting, results relating
                    individual differences in brain organization to behavior to be understood in a general
                    framework. Future work is needed to examine whether modularity as defined by subnetworks
                    of functionally relevant systems would be superior to these whole-brain measures or,
                    rather, the whole-brain measures would maintain an advantage because of the involvement of
                    other regions whose contributions are less clear based on current findings.</p>

                    <p>Some previous resting-state fMRI studies also included averaged signals in the white
                        matter and ventricle as nuisance signals and regressed them out. A recent study by
                        Aurich, Alves Filho, Marques da Silva, and Franco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"
                            >2015</xref>) showed that different preprocessing strategies with respect to these
                        tissue-based signals had an impact on some graph theoretical measures, but this study
                        did not evaluate the effect on the modularity measure. Because of Aurich et
                        al.&#x0027;s findings, we conducted an extra analysis in which the tissue-based (e.g.,
                        white matter and ventricle) regression was included in preprocessing by following the
                            <italic>anaticor</italic> procedure in AFNI (Jo, Saad, Simmons, Milbury, &#x0026;
                        Cox, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2010</xref>). Specifically, we segmented an
                        individual&#x0027;s structural image by using FreeSurfer (Dale, Fischl, &#x0026;
                        Sereno, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1999</xref>; Fischl, Sereno, &#x0026; Dale,
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1999</xref>). Then, white matter and ventricle
                        masks were created and eroded. The averaged time series in eroded ventricle mask and
                        regionally averaged time series within a 15-mm-radius sphere in eroded white matter
                        mask were extracted and included as two additional nuisance signals in the regression
                        model. Results in terms of modularity&#x2013;behavior correlations were similar for
                        both analyses without and with tissue regression. In the text, we report the results
                        without regressing out tissue-based signals, but the results with this additional
                        preprocessing step are reported in a table available on Open Science Framework.</p>

                    <p>Because of the resolution limitation issue with the current community detection

                    <p>The original Power et al.&#x0027;s network consisted of 264 nodes. To apply it to our
                        data, we first converted the coordinates provided in Power et al.&#x0027;s article
                        from Montreal Neurological Institute space to Talairach space by using a converter
                        tool (Lancaster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2007</xref>) in software
                        GingerALE. Then, 10-mm-diameter spheric ROIs were created around coordinates. Eight
                        ROIs in the cerebellum in Talairach space were excluded as they were not covered by
                        images for some of our participants, resulting to 256 nodes in our analyses.</p>

                        volumetric parcellation to our data, using AFNI script
                            <italic>&#x0040;auto&#x005F;tlrc</italic>, we first warped the anatomical template
                        onto which this functional parcellation was coregistered into Talairach space and
                        registered it to the template used in AFNI with linear interpolation. Then, a set of
                        masks for volumetric parcellation were warped into Talairach by using the same
                        transformation and resampled to match the resolution of our data with nearest neighbor
                        interpolation. Craddock et al.&#x0027;s parcellation was applied to our data in a
                        similar way.</p>
